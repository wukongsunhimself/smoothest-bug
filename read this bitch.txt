★ Tdx - Client Multi Device
¿? Since - 17 June - 2024

- This script is still in beta, so there are still several shortcomings that require further improvement. The development of this script was carried out in an unfavorable situation, considering time constraints and the compulsion to use a mobile phone as a replacement for a laptop that was damaged. I am committed to presenting a final, more optimized version at a later date.
